Introducing Ninafer T'sarran NPC

BACKGROUND:
	She started out several years ago as my main character that I used when I used to play good old PnP AD&D games. I used her stats and name when I first bought Baldur's Gate when it first came out. She was the first character that I won the game with. When Baldur's Gate 2 came out I used her once again and she won in SoA and ToB. She is a survivor. ;) So now I have decided to share with you my fellow BG fan one of my favorite characters.

THE FUTURE:
	I have used her as a template for my upcomming mod "The Undying". In that mod there is a NPC by the name of Callisto T'sarran. She is a combination of one of my favorite Xena villians and Ninafer. Callisto is like Ninafer except she is evil and quite insane. They also share the same background and suffering except Callisto kept the revenge and hate in her where Ninafer did not. 


INSTALLING THE NINAFER NPC

Throne Of Bhaal is Required. Though Nina has only SoA content 
for now, features of this mod require the presence of ToB-specific 
files for it to work.

You should obtain and install the latest TOB patch from 
www.interplay.com or www.bioware.com BEFORE installing this mod. 
Install this patch before installing any mods. 

1. Extract the contents of Nina.rar into the BGII - SoA folder 
on your computer.

2. Double-click Setup-Nina.exe. A console window (DOS window) 
opens up and asks whether or not you wish to install Nina. Answer Yes.

3. You'll se a list of files being copied, and scripts and dialogue 
being compiled. This process may take a minute or two on a slower system.

4. Start a new game and enjoy!

Version History:

Version 100b
	First release. Yes the b stands for beta. ;)
